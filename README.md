# Stock Market Prediction with Machine Learning 📈🤖

In this repository, I have developed a machine learning model to predict stock prices and trends using historical data and advanced algorithms. 🧠💹

## Features 🌟

📊 Historical Data Analysis: The model uses past stock data to identify patterns and trends.

📈 Trend Prediction: It predicts whether the stock price will go up or down.

⚡ Advanced Algorithms: Leveraging state-of-the-art techniques like LSTMs and Random Forest.

🔍 Customizable: Easily adapt the model for different stocks or markets.

## How It Works 🛠️

Data Collection: The model uses historical stock price data (e.g., open, close, high, low, volume).

Feature Engineering: Important financial indicators are computed, such as Moving Averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands.

Model Training: The machine learning model is trained on this data to learn patterns.

Prediction: The trained model provides predictions on future stock trends.
